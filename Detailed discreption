This gesture involves using one or both hands to control the audio volume of a device. 
It is recognized by the device through motion tracking, sensors, or cameras, often allowing for touch-free control.

Pinching Movement:

Gesture for Increasing Volume: Start by bringing your thumb and index finger together in a pinch-like motion, then gradually spread them apart. The larger the distance between the fingers, the higher the volume increases.
Gesture for Decreasing Volume: Begin with your thumb and index finger apart, then bring them closer together to reduce the volume.
